This is the list of available interceptors as of this writing

## Official Interceptor

These interceptors are part of **Frest** source. They are distributed
in their own package, so we have to explicitly install them if we want to
use them.

- [frest-json](https://www.npmjs.com/package/frest-json), a set of configurable interceptors to deal with JSON data.
- [frest-auth](https://www.npmjs.com/package/frest-auth), a request interceptor to deal with attaching auth info to the request.
